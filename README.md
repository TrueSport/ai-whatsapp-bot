# <center> ü§ñ AI WhatsApp Bot </center>\n\nThis is a personal project bot that uses the whatsapp-web.js library and the GPT-3.5 Turbo model to automatically respond to WhatsApp messages, as well as using Dall-E to generate images from prompts.\n\n## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used\nThe bot was developed using the following technologies:\n-   [![NestJS](https://img.shields.io/badge/-NestJS-FE0902?logo=nestjs&logoColor=white)](https://nestjs.com/) - Framework that provides scalable architecture for server app development.\n-   [![Prisma](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Prisma-1B222D?logo=prisma&logoColor=white)](https://www.prisma.io/) - ORM that simplifies interaction with databases.\n-   [![PostgreSQL](https://img.shields.io/badge/-PostgreSQL-336791?logo=postgresql&logoColor=white)](https://www.postgresql.org/) - Open-source relational database.\n-   [![OpenAI API](https://img.shields.io/badge/-OpenAI-FF733E?logo=openai&logoColor=white)](https://beta.openai.com/) - API for natural language processing and artificial intelligence.\n-   [![TypeScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/-TypeScript-007ACC?logo=typescript&logoColor=white)](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - JavaScript superset that adds static typing to the language.\n-   [![Fastify](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Fastify-202020?logo=fastify&logoColor=white)](https://www.fastify.io/) - Used as adapter with NestJS focused on performance and scalability.\n\n### üöÄFeatures:\n-   Conversations using ChatGPT's power just by sending messagesvia WhatsApp. ü§ùüí¨\n-   Image generation using the `/imagine your prompt` command. üñºÔ∏èü§ñ\n-   Message history cleaning from the database using the `/clear` command. üóëÔ∏è\n-   Get help on available commands using the `/help` command. ‚ùìü§î\n\nLet's see an example image:\n[![Example image](https://i.postimg.cc/RVqv61bP/image.png)](https://postimg.cc/Tp8zBbxm)\n\n###  üß™How to use?\nTo start using the BOT, follow these steps:\n1. Send a text message to the WhatsApp +55 (88) 98147-8937 or [click here](https://wa.me/558881478937?text=hello).\n\n2. The message will be forwarded to the ChatGPT API to respond automatically. All sent and received messages are stored in a database and will remain there until the `/clear` command is executed to clear the history.\n\nThe use of ChatGPT API and Dall-E are subject to the [OpenAI Terms of Use]([https://beta.openai.com/terms/](https://beta.openai.com/terms/)). Make sure to read and agree with these terms before using the API.\n\n### üõ†Ô∏èInstallation and Setting up\nTo install and set up the API, follow these steps:\n1.  Create an OpenAI account and get your credentials.\nCreate `.env` file. The `.env.example` file is in the project root. See the example below:\n\n```\nOPENAI_API_KEY=\nDATABASE_URL=\nBOT_PERSONA="Bot's Persona"\n\n``` The `DATABASE_URL` field should be filled with your database URL. By default, it is set to use PostgreSQL.\n2.  Install the project dependencies with the following command:\n\n```bash\nnpm install\n```\n3.  Start the API in localhost with the command:\n\n```bash\nnpm run start:dev\n```\n4. Wait for the QR Code to appear on the Terminal, go to "Connected Devices" in your cell phone's WhatsApp and scan the generated QR Code.\n5. Now just send a message to your number and wait for the response.
